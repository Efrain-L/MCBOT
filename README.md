# Minecraft Server Discord Bot
This repository contains the code for a Discord bot that I use to start, close, and manage a personal Minecraft server for a group of friends.
The bot is written using NodeJs and the discord.js API, and currently runs on an Oracle Cloud VM instance where it has access to all the files associated with the Minecraft Server on the same instance.
